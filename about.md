This site is for notes for the AQA ALevel Computer Science course (and so will be in note form). It assumes a reasonable understanding of Computer Science.

## Conventions

-   _italics_ = used when emphasising the language that the markscheme/textbook uses
-   _bold_ = important distinctions, etc made in the markscheme/textbook that should be remembered
-   ~~strikethrough~~ = used when alternate language is used to the markscheme

PS: Here is my [main site](//pozogo.github.io) where I have other stuff other than school work.
